Create table tblEmployee
(
 ID int primary key identity,
 Name nvarchar(50),
 Gender nvarchar(50),
 Salary nvarchar(50)
)

Insert into tblEmployee values('Sara Nani','Female','4500')
Insert into tblEmployee values('James Histo','Male','5300')
Insert into tblEmployee values('Mary Jane','Female','6200')
Insert into tblEmployee values('Paul Sensit','Male','4200')
Insert into tblEmployee values('Mike Jen','Male','5500')

--To achieve this we would write a sql query using GROUP BY as shown below.
Select Gender, Sum(Salary) as Total 
from tblEmployee
Group by Gender

--When you execute this query, we will get an error - Operand data type nvarchar is invalid for sum operator.
--This is because, when we created tblEmployee table, the "Salary" column was created using nvarchar datatype.--
--SQL server Sum() aggregate function can only be applied on numeric columns.
--So, let's try to modify "Salary" column to use int datatype

Alter table tblEmployee
Alter column Salary int
